To Store information about an object, like a car we use a Dictionary:

Color: blue
Model: Corvette
Price: $50


if you need to split the model into years then you can use a dictionary within a dictionary

ex:

Color: blue
Model:
  Name: Corvette
  Year: 1995
Price: $50


If you want to store list of multiple items of the same object, say cars with different colours then use a list


ex:
simple list 

- Blue Corvette
- Grey Corvette
- Red Corvette


if we want all the info like we had before we create a list of dictionairies, we then change our list from a list of strings to a list of dictionaries

- Blue Corvette
  Model:
    Name: Corvette
    Model: 1995
